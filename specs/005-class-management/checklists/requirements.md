## Validation Summary

**Date**: 2025-11-24
**Result**: PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and approved. The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase.

### Key Highlights:
- 6 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) covering all requested APIs
- 26 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 10 measurable success criteria (performance, capacity, user experience)
- 8 edge cases identified for consideration during implementation
- Clear scope boundaries with comprehensive "Out of Scope" section
- All clarifications resolved (archiving policy: allow with enrolled students)

### Next Steps:
The specification is ready for either:
- `/speckit.plan` - Proceed to implementation planning
- `/speckit.clarify` - Optional: Ask additional clarification questions if needed
